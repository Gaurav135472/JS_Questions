1. Style and Formatting
Documentation and Comments
Observation: The code lacks detailed comments, particularly in crucial sections such as those handling update and deletion operations. This lack of documentation makes the flow of the code harder to follow.
Suggested Improvement: Add concise comments explaining the purpose of each function and complex logic block. For instance, it would be helpful to provide context around the "update" and "delete" functions to make the code’s intent clearer.
Indentation
Observation: Inconsistent indentation (a mix of tabs and spaces) is noticeable throughout the file, which disrupts the code’s readability.
Suggested Improvement: Standardize indentation using a consistent scheme (e.g., 4 spaces per indentation level) for a more organized and uniform layout.
Variable Naming
Observation: Variable names like $sql and $conn are generic, making it harder to discern their role in the code.
Suggested Improvement: Opt for descriptive variable names, such as $studentInsertQuery or $databaseConnection, to provide clarity about each variable’s purpose.

2. Security and Error Handling
SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
Observation: The code directly incorporates user input into SQL statements, increasing the risk of SQL injection attacks.
Suggested Improvement: Replace raw SQL statements with prepared statements that use bound parameters to securely handle user input. For instance, binding parameters in the SQL query can help secure sensitive data handling.
Error Handling
Observation: The code lacks robust error handling, so if a database operation fails, the user has no feedback to indicate the issue.
Suggested Improvement: Integrate error-handling mechanisms for database interactions to confirm each operation’s success and display user-friendly messages in case of failure, which will aid in debugging and improve user experience.
Input Validation
Observation: There is no server-side validation for the form fields (first_name, last_name, and gpa), allowing potentially invalid data entries.
Suggested Improvement: Add server-side checks to confirm first_name and last_name contain valid characters, and that gpa is a number within a valid range. Client-side validation with JavaScript could also be added to prevent invalid entries upfront.

3. Functionality Review
Adding Students
Observation: The function to add students works as intended but lacks user feedback to confirm that the new student was added.
Suggested Improvement: Display a success message after adding a student so that users can confirm their action was completed.
Updating Student Records
Observation: The page reloads after a student record update, but there is no feedback to confirm the update was successful.
Suggested Improvement: Display a message confirming the update, and ensure that the update only occurs if data has actually changed to prevent unnecessary database writes.
Deleting Students
Observation: The "delete" functionality uses a GET request, which could lead to unintentional deletions if a user accidentally clicks a link or bookmarks it.
Suggested Improvement: Use a POST request and a confirmation dialog for the delete action. This will provide users with a safeguard against accidental deletions and is a more secure approach.
Page Reloads and Form Display
Observation: The form refreshes the entire page upon submission, and there is no visual feedback indicating the success of an action.
Suggested Improvement: Use AJAX to submit forms without reloading the page, providing users with a smoother experience and immediate feedback.

4. Database Connection Management
Connection Setup
Observation: Database connection code is embedded directly in the file, and connections are not explicitly closed, which may lead to resource inefficiencies.
Suggested Improvement: Move the database connection details to a separate configuration file and ensure each connection is closed after the operation completes.
Direct SQL Statements
Observation: SQL statements are directly embedded in the code, which could make maintenance more complex as the application scales.
Suggested Improvement: For better code organization, consider using a separate database interaction layer or an ORM for managing SQL statements, especially if the project grows in complexity.

5. User Interface and Experience
Form Display Behavior
Observation: The "Add Student" form remains visible on the page even when editing a student, which might confuse users.
Suggested Improvement: Hide the "Add Student" form when editing a student and ensure that placeholders in the form fields provide helpful context for each input.
User Feedback for Actions
Observation: There is no visible feedback after actions such as adding, editing, or deleting a student, leaving users uncertain about the success of their actions.
Suggested Improvement: Add success or error messages after each action. This will improve the user experience by providing clear confirmation of their actions.
